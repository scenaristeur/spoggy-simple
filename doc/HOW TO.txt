A. How to take notes with spoggy-simple ?

1 open Spoggy-Simple at https://scenaristeur.github.io/spoggy-simple/
2 You can use Spoggy-Simple in "Fullscreen mode" by clicking "Utiliser Spoggy en plein ecran"
   & return in normal with "escape key" or "close icon" 
2 click on the Keyboard Button
3 type your triples as a group of three words
 -> with double quotes when there is a space in the node or edge 
 -> that ends with an "End Character" that could be :
		- a dot 		. 	if you want to clear all the input
		- a semicolon 	;	if you want to keep the subject and property and clear the object of triplet
		- a coma		,	if you want to keep the subject and clear property and object
		- a hyphen      -   if you want to to the object as the subject for the next triple

With no "End Character" the triple is not registered. I have forgotten !!!! GRRRR !!!!
You can edit Nodes & Edges with the appropriate buttons.
And in theory you can export to your POD ... in Progress !!!

1 & 2 : steps 1 & 2 are the same as above ;-)
3 click the "universal browser" button
4 click the "Se connecter sur un POD" button
5 login
6 click another time the "universal browser" button
7 copy & paste the path (here is a little bug) 
8 click "importer" button and close with "Fermer" button

Then you can explore a POD and expand folders & ttl files
